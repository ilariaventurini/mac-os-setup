# Mac OS setup

This repository is probably not very interesting to anyone but me.
It contains everything (or almost) that I think is necessary have on a new Mac: softwares, system settings and dotfiles.

## Install stuff

```bash
bash ./do-it-all.sh
```

## Install manually

- **uTorrent: to donwload things**
- **logitech options: for mouse MX vertical**
- **cat run: the cat living in the menubar runs at the speed according to the CPU usage**
- photoshop: you know
- printer drivers
