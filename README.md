# Mac OS setup
This repository is probably not very interesting to anyone but me. It's all about the things that need to be done to get a fresh install of Mac OS X configured to my liking. I'm writing all of this down here so that I do not have to think too much when reinstalling the system.

## System Preferences

## Install stuff

```bash
./install.sh
```

It install a lot of useful things:

- node
- spotify
- etc

## Install manually

<!-- - utorrent

- cat run - The cat living in the menubar runs at the speed according to the CPU usage
- photoshop

- estensioni google
